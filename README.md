# langraph chat ðŸš€

This is a simple chat app I built using Langraph and Langchain.
Right now, itâ€™s just a basic console-based interface where you can chat with a model.

It saves your chat history using JSON files, so even if you restart the app, you can continue the convo like nothing happened.

I built this mostly for fun (and learning), and I plan to add more stuff later, maybe a web interface, maybe more features, who knows.

Most of the demos I found online use Python, so I wanted to show how to do it with JavaScript/TypeScript using Bun instead.

[![Langchain](https://img.shields.io/badge/Langchain-AI-brightgreen?logo=langchain)](https://langchain.com/)

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) â€” Fast JavaScript runtime
- [Langraph](https://langraph.com/) â€” Framework for building AI apps
- [Langchain](https://langchain.com/) â€” Framework for LLM-powered stuff
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) â€” Needed for Bun
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) â€” Because types are cool
- [ollama deepseek-r1 local model](https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1) â€” For the chat model

## Installation

```bash
bun install
```

## Usage

```bash
bun run dev
```

Type `/exit` in the chat console to quit.

---

## Known Issues

- Chat history is saved in a single JSON file (can get messy).
- JSON format isn't ideal for chat history, but works for now.
- File may get corrupted if the app crashes.
- If corrupted, delete the file and start over.

---

## Up Next

- Improve chat history management
- Switch to a better storage (e.g., database)
- Add a web interface
- Integrate tools (search, etc.)

---

## Notes

This is a demo app, built for fun and learning how to use Langraph and Langchain with Bun.
